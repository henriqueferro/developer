This project demonstrates how to implement  in GraalVM for Java applications using the Truffle API and Espresso project. It provides a secure environment for executing Java code by leveraging GraalVM's capabilities, ensuring that the execution is contained within a sandbox.

This is a OCI learning recommendation service built with Spring AI, OpeAI, and GraalVM. The base is a regular Spring app, and the integration with OpenAI is implemented in `RecommendationLearning`. Note that the app is using `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Change a valid Open API key on application.properties:
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPENAI_API_KEY}

## Build a native app with GraalVM:

```shell
mvn -Pnative native:compile -DskipTests
```

## Start the app and navigate to the learning request form:

```shell
./target/learningapp http://localhost:8080/
```
